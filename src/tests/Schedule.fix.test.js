/**
 * This test file demonstrates how to fix the duplicate styled-component declarations
 * in the Schedule.tsx file.
 * 
 * The following components are duplicated and need to be renamed:
 * 1. DateNavigationWeek (lines 198 and 1157)
 * 2. DateCell (lines 1272 and 2224)
 * 3. DayName (lines 1301 and 2253)
 * 4. TimeSlot (lines 1450 and 1937)
 * 5. DayColumn (lines 1513 and 2290)
 * 6. ClassEvent (lines 1550 and 2326)
 * 7. ClassEventContent (lines 1585 and 2350)
 * 8. NoClassesMessage (lines 1751 and 2059)
 * 
 * Fix strategy:
 * 1. For each duplicated component, rename the second occurrence to include context:
 *    - The first set is used at the top level
 *    - Second set is usually within WeekView or DayView components
 * 
 * Example fixes:
 * - DateNavigationWeek -> DateNavigationSecondary
 * - DateCell -> DateCellWeekView
 * - DayName -> DayNameWeekView
 * - TimeSlot -> TimeSlotDay/TimeSlotWeek
 * - DayColumn -> DayColumnWeekView
 * - ClassEvent -> ClassEventView
 * - ClassEventContent -> ClassEventContentView
 * - NoClassesMessage -> NoClassesMessageView
 * 
 * Also update any interfaces like ClassEventProps if they have duplicates
