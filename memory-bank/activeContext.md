# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Setting up the initial project structure and documentation
- Creating core UI components
- Implementing authentication with Supabase
- Developing the course management functionality

## Recent Changes
- Project initialized with React, TypeScript, and Vite
- Added Tailwind CSS for styling
- Integrated Supabase for authentication and database
- Set up project structure with feature-based organization
- Added GitHub Pages deployment configuration

## Next Steps
1. Complete the authentication flow
2. Build the dashboard interface
3. Implement course creation and management
4. Develop content organization components
5. Add user progress tracking functionality

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Using Zustand for state management due to its simplicity and performance
- Implementing a mobile-first responsive design
- Leveraging Supabase for both authentication and data storage
- Using TypeScript throughout the application for type safety
- Following a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Component names should be PascalCase
- File names should match component names
- Prefer functional components with hooks over class components
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Follow the container/presentation pattern where appropriate
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling with styled-components for complex cases
- Follow consistent folder structure for new features

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Supabase provides a comprehensive solution for auth and storage needs
- Zustand simplifies state management compared to Redux
- Vite significantly improves development experience with fast refreshes
- TypeScript helps catch errors early in development
- Tailwind CSS accelerates UI development with utility classes
