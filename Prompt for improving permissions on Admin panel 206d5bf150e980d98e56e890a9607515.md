# Prompt for improving permissions on Admin panel

What you're doing now is that the permissions created by the system for each page and stored in Supabase (permissions starting with "access") are checked by the user for the first time on the site, based on their role and for each page that belongs to their role, and while this process is ongoing, you need to inform the user with some kind of loading state. The user should not be able to access any page that is outside of their role. You should give access to pages that are related to their role based on their permissions and store which pages they have access to in a common Zustand store and accordingly check and render both the links in the Sidebar and the content of each page accordingly. Just please, don't send too many requests to Supabase. One more thing, when checking permissions on each page, avoid over-rendering. Also the links in the Sidebar. When I go from one page to another in the Admin panel, the links in the Sidebar disappear for a moment and then return to their place again, and The content on each page is also rendered at least twice. At the beginning, the main content of the page is displayed, and then the loading state with the message Checking permissions... is displayed, and then the full content of the site is displayed. Either you should first check the permissions completely and be 10000000% sure that the user has permission to this page or not, and then grant access, or you can determine which pages the user has permission to when they first enter the site and avoid unnecessary checks not when entering each page, but when they first enter the site.

**WARNING**: Don‚Äôt change the current state and flow of the design on Sidebar links and other parts of the project. Just implement the logic as described below. Also the code examples might not be precise with the current codebase on the project. You just need to adapt the logic into our current codebase and be flexible about the idea 

</aside>

## ‚úÖ Objective

- Fetch a user‚Äôs `access_` permissions **once** on app load based on their `role_id`.
- Prevent over-rendering and loading flickers.
- Render only pages and sidebar links the user is allowed to access.
- Store everything in Zustand for fast in-app permission checks.

---

## 1. üß† Supabase Schema Summary

You have:

- `permissions (id, name, description, category)`
- `role_permissions (role_id, permission_id)`
- Each `name` in `permissions` is a unique string like: `access_admin_dashboard`, etc.

---

## 2. üì¶ Zustand Permission Store

```tsx

import { create } from 'zustand'

type PermissionStore = {
  loading: boolean
  allowedPages: string[]
  setPermissions: (permissions: string[]) => void
  checkPermission: (path: string) => boolean
  reset: () => void
}

export const usePermissionStore = create<PermissionStore>((set, get) => ({
  loading: true,
  allowedPages: [],
  setPermissions: (permissions) => set({ allowedPages: permissions, loading: false }),
  checkPermission: (path) => get().allowedPages.includes(path),
  reset: () => set({ loading: true, allowedPages: [] }),
}))
```

---

## 3. üåê Fetch Permissions Once on App Load

You‚Äôll fetch from `permissions` via `role_permissions`.

```tsx

import { supabase } from './supabaseClient'
import { usePermissionStore } from '@/stores/permissionStore'

export const initPermissions = async (roleId: string) => {
  const { setPermissions } = usePermissionStore.getState()

  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('role_permissions')
    .select('permission:permissions(name)')
    .eq('role_id', roleId)

  if (error) {
    console.error('‚ùå Failed to load permissions', error)
    setPermissions([])
    return
  }

  const accessPermissions = data
    .map((rp) => rp.permission.name)
    .filter((p) => p.startsWith('access:'))

  const allowedPages = accessPermissions.map((key) => '/' + key.replace('access:', ''))

  setPermissions(allowedPages)
}
```

Call this on first app mount or after login:

```tsx

useEffect(() => {
  if (user?.role_id) {
    initPermissions(user.role_id)
  }
}, [user])
```

## 4. üö™ Page Protection with `PermissionGate`

```tsx
import { usePermissionStore } from '@/stores/permissionStore'
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'
import { useEffect } from 'react'

export const PermissionGate = ({ path, children }: { path: string; children: React.ReactNode }) => {
  const { loading, checkPermission } = usePermissionStore()
  const router = useRouter()

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!loading && !checkPermission(path)) {
      router.replace('/unauthorized') // or your fallback
    }
  }, [loading, path])

  if (loading) return <p>üîê Checking permissions...</p>

  return checkPermission(path) ? <>{children}</> : null
}
```

Wrap each protected page:

```tsx
export default function UsersPage() {
  return (
    <PermissionGate path="/users">
      <h1>Users</h1>
      {/* Page content */}
    </PermissionGate>
  )
}
```

---

## 5. üß≠ Sidebar Links Without Flicker

```tsx

import { usePermissionStore } from '@/stores/permissionStore'

const routes = [
  { label: 'Dashboard', path: '/dashboard' },
  { label: 'Users', path: '/users' },
  { label: 'Settings', path: '/settings' },
]

export const Sidebar = () => {
  const { loading, allowedPages } = usePermissionStore()

  if (loading) return null

  return (
    <aside>
      <ul>
        {routes
          .filter((route) => allowedPages.includes(route.path))
          .map((route) => (
            <li key={route.path}>
              <a href={route.path}>{route.label}</a>
            </li>
          ))}
      </ul>
    </aside>
  )
}
```

## 6. üßπ Optional: Reset Store on Logout

```tsx
import { usePermissionStore } from '@/stores/permissionStore'

export const logout = async () => {
  await supabase.auth.signOut()
  usePermissionStore.getState().reset()
}
```
