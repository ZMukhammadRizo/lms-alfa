# Attendance Feature Implementation

## Overview

The attendance feature has been successfully implemented as part of the Teacher module. The feature allows teachers to:

1. View student attendance for all lessons at once in a table format
2. Mark students as present or absent with a simple click
3. Toggle between present and absent status
4. Easily navigate between grades and attendance data

## Integration Details

The attendance system is fully integrated with the existing grades journal. Key components include:

1. **Tabbed Interface**:

   - Users can switch between "Grades" and "Attendance" tabs
   - Both views share the same header, class, and subject context

2. **Table Layout**:

   - Students are displayed in rows on the left side
   - All lessons are displayed as columns across the top
   - Attendance status for each student/lesson combination is shown in the corresponding cell
   - The layout mirrors the grades journal for consistency

3. **Attendance UI**:

   - Attendance status is indicated with green checkmarks (present) or red X (absent)
   - Interactive buttons allow toggling between present and absent statuses
   - Visual indicators make it easy to scan attendance patterns

4. **Data Storage**:
   - Attendance data is stored in the `attendance` table in Supabase
   - The table uses a composite key of `lesson_id` and `student_id` to uniquely identify records
   - Row-level security ensures teachers can only access and modify data for their classes

## Technical Implementation

### Key Files

1. **GradesJournal.tsx**: Main container component that handles:

   - Loading data for classes, students, and lessons
   - Managing the tabbed interface
   - Passing student and lesson data to the Attendance tab

2. **AttendanceTab.tsx**: Specialized component that:

   - Displays the attendance UI in a table format
   - Handles toggling attendance status
   - Shows loading states and empty states

3. **attendanceStore.ts**: Zustand store that:
   - Manages attendance data fetching and updating
   - Provides optimistic UI updates
   - Handles error states
   - Supports fetching attendance for multiple lessons at once

### Data Flow

1. User selects a class, grade level, and subject
2. The system loads students and lessons for the selected criteria
3. The AttendanceTab automatically fetches attendance data for all lessons
4. User can view and toggle attendance status for each student/lesson combination
5. Changes are immediately saved to the database

## Testing the Feature

To test the attendance feature:

1. Navigate to the Teacher module and select a class
2. Go to the grades journal page
3. Verify that you can see the tabs for "Grades" and "Attendance"
4. Switch to the "Attendance" tab
5. Verify that you can see a table with all students and lessons
6. Click on a student's attendance status to toggle between present and absent
7. Verify that the UI updates instantly
8. Refresh the page and check that the attendance status persists

## Notes for Future Improvements

1. Add attendance statistics and reporting
2. Implement bulk attendance actions (mark all present/absent)
3. Add attendance history view
4. Integrate with notifications for absent students
5. Add custom attendance statuses (e.g., late, excused)
